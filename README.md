Create a json file like this:

            {
                "title":"any_title",
                "link":"http://your_url"
            },
            ...

        ],

        "group_name_2":[
            ...
        ]

        ...
    }

save the file in your smartphone with '.json' extension

    eg. file.json

if you're opening the app the first time you will be asked to select a file, choose the file you created.
